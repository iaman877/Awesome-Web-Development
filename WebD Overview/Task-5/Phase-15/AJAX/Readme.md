# AJAX 
AJAX is a developer's dream, because we can do the fallowing stuff :
* Update a web page without reloading the page
* Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
* Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
* Send data to a server - in the background

## "XMLHttpRequest" vs "Fetch" vs  "async and await"
* XMLHttpRequest wasn’t made for the things we are using it today. Also, it’s API is kinda messed. The Fetch API makes it easier to make asynchronous requests and handle responses better than using an XMLHttpRequest. Fetch allows us to create a better API for the simple things, using modern JavaScript features like promises.
* async and await make promises easier to write in two ways 
  * async makes a function return a Promise
  * await makes a function wait for a Promise
