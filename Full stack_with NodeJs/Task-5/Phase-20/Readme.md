# Introduction to Mongo DB(NO SQL data Base)
1. MongoDB is an open source, document-oriented database designed with both scalability and developer agility in mind. 
2. Instead of storing your data in tables and rows as you would with a relational database, in MongoDB you store JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (schema-free, schemaless)
