Other elements can be used either as block level elements or inline elements. This includes the following elements:
APPLET - embedded Java applet
IFRAME - Inline frame
INS - inserted text
MAP - image map
OBJECT - embedded object
SCRIPT - script within an HTML document

You can insert inline elements inside block elements. For example, you can have multiple <span> elements inside a <div> element.

Note:  Inline elements cannot contain any block level elements.
