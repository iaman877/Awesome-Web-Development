n HTML, most elements are defined as block level or inline elements.
Block level elements start from a new line.
For example: <h1>, <form>, <li>, <ol>, <ul>, <p>, <pre>, <table>, <div>, etc.

Inline elements are normally displayed without line breaks.
For example: <b>, <a>, <strong>, <img>, <input>, <em>, <span>, etc.

The <div> element is a block-level element that is often used as a container for other HTML elements.


<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Headline</h1>
    <div style="background-color:green; color:white; padding:20px;">
      <p>Some paragraph text goes here.</p>
      <p>Another paragraph goes here.</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

Similarly, the <span> element is an inline element that is often used as a container for some text.

<html>
  <body>
    <h2>Some 
      <span style="color:red">Important</span>
    Message</h2>
  </body>
</html>

The <div> element defines a block-level section in a document.
The <span> element defines an inline section in a document.
