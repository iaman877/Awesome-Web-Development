# The <a> Tag

Links are also an integral part of every web page. You can add links to text or images that will enable the user to click on them in order to be directed to another file or webpage.
In HTML, links are defined using the <a> tag.

Use the href attribute to define the link's destination address:

```
<a href=""></a>

```
