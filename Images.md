# Images 

Creating good alternative text is almost an art. The good news is that it is an art that even artistically-challenged people like myself can do well. The key is to think about the meanings behind your images, not a description of them. So here are some tips:

Tips
* _*Decide what information the image conveys*_: Does someone need to see the page to understand your message? If not, you can treat the image as decorative use a null (empty) text alternative (alt=""). Make sure not to include a space inside the quotes since some screen readers may then read it aloud.

* _*If the image is information, be complete, but concise*_: In most cases you should be able to use a short phrase or sentence as alt text.
