A page can be divided into frames using a special frame document.

The <frame> tag defines one specific window (frame) within a <frameset>. Each <frame> in a <frameset> can have different attributes, such as border, scrolling, the ability to resize, etc.

The <frameset> element specifies the number of columns or rows in the frameset, as well as what percentage or number of pixels of space each of them occupies.
```
<frameset cols="100, 25%, *"></frameset>
<frameset rows="100, 25%, *"></frameset>
```

> The <frameset> tag is not supported in HTML5.
