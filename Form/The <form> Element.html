HTML forms are used to collect information from the user.
Forms are defined using the <form> element, with its opening and closing tags:

<body>
   <form>â€¦</form>
</body>

Use the action attribute to point to a webpage that will load after the user submits the form.
<form action="http://www.google.com"> 
</form>

Usually the form is submitted to a web page on a web server.
